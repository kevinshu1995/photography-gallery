  "description": "Tokyo tower\nClimbing Tokyo Tower’s 600-step staircase offers a unique and refreshing experience. It takes about 12 to 15 minutes to reach the main observation deck at 150 meters, where you can enjoy panoramic views of Tokyo and feel the fresh breeze along the way. It’s a slow, rewarding journey that few get to experience by foot.\n\nAnd yes I did climb.",
